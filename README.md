🎬 Movie Recommender App
This interactive Movie Recommender App lets users quickly find movie suggestions based on their typing input!

🚀 How It Works
Users start typing the name of a movie into the input box.

Once the input reaches at least 5 characters, the app searches for matching movie titles from a dataset.

It automatically selects the closest match and uses it to recommend similar movies.

Recommendations are displayed live in an output box right next to the input.

✨ Key Features
Real-time search: Recommendations update dynamically as you type.

Simple and clean interface powered by ipywidgets.

Instant suggestions based on movie similarity, making it easy to discover new favorites.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

ipywidgets for building the interactive UI

Pandas (assumed for handling movie datasets)

Similarity search (e.g., content-based filtering or collaborative filtering depending on find_similar_movies() logic)

📦 Example Use Case
You type "Grumpier Old Men" → the app finds it instantly → recommends several similar comedies or related movies you might enjoy!
